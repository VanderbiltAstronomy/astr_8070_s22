    "A **[loss function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_functions_for_classification)** is like a cost function, or a likelihood, or optimization function, or an objective function. We're trying to minimize the offset between a model and some data. The difference with a loss function is that we evaluate it on a single training example rather than the full data set.\n",

    "For classification we plot the **loss vs. $(y\\times f(x))$**, where the latter corresponds to the known class (either $+1$ or $-1$) times the predicted value. If that product is positive, we predict $+1$. If it is negative, we predict $-1$. We define the loss to be zero for $y*f(x)=1$, that is, when we have gotten the right answer.\n",

    "\"*On vs. Off*\" activation actually isn't quite true or what we want. The way your eyes work is that you need 1-10 photons to trigger a rod, but several rods must be triggered to send a signal to the brain. The sigmoid activation function captures the probabilistic nature of neuron firing. More importantly it is differentiable, so can be used for backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect of non-linear activation functions is that they are what allow neural networks to solve non-linear problems.  If we used a strictly linear activation function, then we could only solve linear problems.  That is, you could fit a straight line, but not an exponential.\n",

    "However, neural network research suffered significant limitations and problems at the hands of the [vanishing and exploding gradients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem) problem.  We won't go into detail there except to say that ***around 2010 there were suggestions for different activation functions that were published.***  \n",

    "- For example, the **[Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rectifier_(neural_networks))** is another commonly used activation function as it solves the vanishing gradient problem (since the gradient is only 0 or 1).\n",

    "- It isn't ideal both because the derivative is 0 for $z<0$ and it can end up producing dead nodes. However, it is fast and the resulting sparsity can be good (sort of like regularization).\n",

    "- A number of papers since 2015 describe various improvements, including the **Leaky ReLU**, the **exponential linear unit (ELU)**, and **scaled exponential linear unit (SELU)**.\n",

    "Note that the activation functions can be different in different layers.  For example, for regression, one typically doesn't use any activation function in the output layer as including one would restrict the range of possible outputs."
