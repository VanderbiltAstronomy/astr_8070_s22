    "The amount of raw information that is being generated every minute is extraordinary. So, whether we like it or not, we have entered the realm of **\"Big Data\"**. However, even in the realm of **\"Small Data\"**, a proper statistical treatment that accounts for statistical and systematic noise, as well as as signal dependencies on the measured output, is essential. My work in Gravitational Wave Astrophysics is far more on the \"Small Data\" side of things. I'll give you a taste of both worlds.\n",

These instruments extract detailed information about GW-emitting systems from **signals buried deep, deep within noise**. The techniques required to do this are at the forefront of data-based inferece, relying heavily on **Bayesian techniques** (we delve into Bayesian inference in a few weeks).\n",
