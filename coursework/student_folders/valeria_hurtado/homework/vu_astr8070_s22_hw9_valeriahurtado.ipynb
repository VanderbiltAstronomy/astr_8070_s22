Write down an equation that algebraically describes the output of this network, in terms of the synapse weights, the neuron bias, and the input data. Based on your equation, will this model learn any nonlinearities? Run the network to confirm your guess.\n",

    "1. Read in the same galaxy color data as used in Homework 8. Slice the data array to only take every other $10$th row. From this reduced data volume, create arrays of $(u-g)$, $(g-r)$, $(r-i)$, and $(i-z)$ colors. Also create arrays of redshift and the spectral class. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We're going to make classification pretty tough for our deep neural network. Make a scatter plot of $(r-i)$ versus $(i-z)$, color coding by galaxy or quasar class. Notice how much more difficult the visual discrimination is compared to $(u-g)$ versus $(g-r)$. The plot should include appropriate axis labels and a legend.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stack the $(r-i)$ and $(i-z)$ colors into a data matrix, $X$. Create a target label array that has $0$ for a regular galaxy and $1$ for a quasar. Perform a train-test split, taking $20\\%$ of the data for testing. Set the `random_state` in your train-test split to be `42` for reproducibility (and easy comparison with my solutions).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scale your training and testing data to prepare it for the DNN. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Train scikit-learn's multi-layer perceptron classifier with ReLU activation, stochastic gradient descent, two hidden layers of respective sizes of $5$ and $2$, and using `max_iter=1000`, and `random_state=42`. As with classifiers in last week's homework, plot an ROC curve that shows the network's performance on the scaled testing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Now let's optimize the hyperparameters of your network. You will use `GridSearchCV` with the following hyperparameters for the network:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "parameters = {'solver': ['lbfgs', 'sgd', 'adam'], \n",
    "              'hidden_layer_sizes': [(2,2), (5,5), (5,2), (5,5,5)], \n",
    "              'activation': ['relu', 'tanh'], \n",
    "              'random_state': [42], 'max_iter': [1000]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you can utilize all availables cores on your machine with `n_jobs=-1`. Print out the classification score for the training data, and the best parameters obtained by the cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Fit a new DNN using the best hyperparameters obtained in (6), and make a plot that has ROC curves for this new network and your original network. Let the x and y axes have the full limit range of 0 to 1. Voila!"
